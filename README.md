# Monte-Carlo-Ising-Model

This is a simple code for running monte carlo simulations on the 2D Ising Model to find thermodynamic functions and the transition temperature.  \\
The notebook named 'testing.ipynb' contains the plots of the thermodynamic functions and the calculated value for Tc for N=30x30 spins. \\
The generated dataset is not included in this github repository, it can be generated using the script main.py
